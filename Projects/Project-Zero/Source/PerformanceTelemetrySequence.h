// 🧩 The frame loop's performance reporter: CPU pacing, real GPU stage timings and the workload that produced them,
//    written to ProjectZero_TelemetryReport as MEASUREMENT ROWS on a wall-clock cadence.
//
//    Why rows and not log lines. The report used to contain no performance or GPU entries at all. The frame loop was
//    not silent — it logged frame times, per-stage timings and cluster counts — but every one of them went through
//    RecordMessage, which writes a SENTENCE. RecordMeasurement is the call that writes
//    "Measurement: <token> = <value> [<unit>]", and nothing in the application ever called it; only the offline
//    CpuReferenceMain did. The numbers existed and scrolled past as prose, so nothing could parse, diff or trend
//    them. Both forms are emitted here: the sentence for someone reading the log, the row for everything else.
//
//    Why the GPU numbers are trustworthy. They are device timestamps, not host-side clocks. VisibilityExchange
//    writes them from its Vulkan query pool around each stage and scales by timestampPeriod, so "ReSTIR 6.2 ms" is
//    the dispatch as the GPU measured it, not what the submission looked like from the CPU. They read as invalid
//    until the pool has a completed frame to report, which is why the telemetry is gated on Valid — a stage that
//    did not run this frame contributes zero rather than garbage.
//
//    Why a wall-clock cadence rather than every N frames. The cost of reporting then does not scale with frame rate,
//    and a run that stalls still produces rows — a frame-count cadence goes quiet exactly when the timings would be
//    most interesting.
//
//    Engine ⇄ project seam: this lives in the PROJECT. It reads the engine's telemetry and writes the project's
//    report; the engine is told nothing about either.
