# Important Notes — Architectural & Migration Invariants

Durable engineering rules, non-negotiable architectural invariants, and reference policies for
**Frontier**. Newest and highest-severity mandates sit at the top.

---

## 🔴 1. GPU-ONLY VIEWPORT OVERLAYS & `.slang` SHADER MANDATE (2026-11-10)

- **100% GPU Rasterization for Visual Overlays**: All debug visuals, viewport reference grids (`NavigationOverlay`), 3D/2D transform manipulators (`TransformGizmo`), wireframe diagnostic shapes/lines/rays (`DiagnosticPrimitives`, `SpatialAnnotation`, `VectorAnnotation`), and world/screen callouts (`TextAnnotation`) **MUST be drawn directly on the GPU** via dedicated `.slang` `…Rasterization` units.
- **Never Draw Viewport Overlays on CPU or ImGui**:
  - 🔴 **NEVER** rasterize grids, gizmos, or debug lines on the CPU.
  - 🔴 **NEVER** submit viewport grids, 3D gizmos, or debug wireframes through ImGui (`ImDrawList`). ImGui is strictly for docked editor panels, inspectors, ribbons, and chrome controls.
  - 🔴 **NEVER** scatter ad-hoc raw Vulkan draw boilerplate across editor/engine tools; all GPU draw encoding routes cleanly through `GeometricRaster/` (`RenderDeviceInterface`, `IndirectDrawEncoder`) backed by **Slang (`.slang`)** shaders.
- **Slang (`.slang`) Exclusively**: Every shader in `Engine/Shaders/` is authored in `.slang` and compiled via `slangc` (`Automation/PrepareShaderToolchain.py`). Do not introduce raw `.glsl` or `.hlsl` shader sources.

---

## 🔴 2. CROSS-PLATFORM PORTABILITY MANDATE — WINDOWS · LINUX · ANDROID (2026-11-10)

- **Universal Device Support**: Frontier is architected from day one to compile and run on **Windows** (Win32/DXGI/Vulkan), **Linux** (X11 & Wayland), **Android** (NDK / `ANativeWindow` / ARM64), and **Headless validation** (`PlatformWindowStub`).
- **Platform Isolation**:
  - Keep OS headers strictly inside `PlatformWindow{Win32,X11,Wayland,Android,Stub}.cpp` and hardware-endpoint `.cpp` files.
  - Note that `glfw` covers desktop windowing only; Android uses `PlatformWindowAndroid.cpp` (`ANativeWindow` / `GameActivity`), so `Engine/Input/` and `Engine/Windowing/` expose platform-neutral C++20 interfaces supporting keyboard, mouse, controller, **and multi-touch/stylus** events natively.
  - Never hardcode x86-only SIMD intrinsics without an ARM64 NEON / scalar path.

## 🔴 3. CRUCIAL IMGUI 8-PATCH STACK INVARIANT (`PatchA`–`PatchH`) (2026-11-10)

- `ExternalPackages/imgui` (pinned at `3bae66c735670619baf51391eba7f3d90a25d125`) **MUST** have all eight stacked patches in `Automation/Patches/` applied in exact order `A → H` via `Automation/ApplyImGuiPatches.py`:
  1. `PatchA-TrapezoidalTabs.patch`
  2. `PatchB-TabOverlapZOrder.patch`
  3. `PatchC-RoundTabButtons.patch`
  4. `PatchD-TabAddButton.patch`
  5. `PatchE-NoTabScrollButtons.patch`
  6. `PatchF-TabContentInsets.patch`
  7. `PatchG-AdjacentTabAddButton.patch`
  8. `PatchH-SmoothOverscroll.patch`
- `CMakeLists.txt` runs `python3 Automation/PrepareDependencies.py --verify` at configure time (which verifies all 8 package pins **and** all 8 ImGui patch tags) and defines `ImDrawIdx=unsigned int` on `FrontierImGui` so dense thumbnail/icon draw lists never overflow 16-bit indices.
- Never edit files inside `ExternalPackages/` manually; any third-party adjustment must be a reproducible script/patch in `Automation/` (such as `ApplyImGuiPatches.py` and `StageThorVG.py`).

## 🔴 4. REFERENCE-ONLY / ANTI-DUPLICATION POLICY FOR `Frontier-OLD` (2026-11-10)

Reference repository: `https://github.com/egoistm1inbox/Frontier-OLD/tree/arena/d96da802-frontier`

| Scenario When Consulting `Frontier-OLD` | Mandatory Action |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Verified dependency pin, patch, or algorithm needed | Reference `Frontier-OLD` for exact pins/math, then author clean C++20 / `.slang` code conforming to **this** repository's `FolderStructure.md`, `BannedWordsVocabulary.md`, and `CodingStandards.md`. |
| Equivalent capability already exists in `Frontier` | 🔴 **Do NOT duplicate.** Wire callers into the existing `Frontier` implementation. |
| Legacy file in `Frontier-OLD` contains banned vocabulary (`Hub`, `Bloom`, `ObjectReservoir`, `Dispatcher`, `.glsl`, ImGui gizmos) | 🔴 **Never blind-copy.** Refactor to compliant mechanisms, C++20 concepts/templates, and `.slang` GPU units before landing here. |

---

## 🔴 5. THREE-PROFILE BUILD POLICY (`Editor` · `Development` · `Shipping`) (2026-11-10)

- **`FRONTIER_PROFILE_EDITOR`** (`-DFRONTIER_PROFILE=Editor`): Compiles and links `Engine/Editor/`, authoring workspaces, inspectors, console, and GPU `.slang` overlays. Runs directly from the build tree without packaging.
- **`FRONTIER_PROFILE_DEVELOPMENT`** (`-DFRONTIER_PROFILE=Development`): Standalone project runtime with developer compile flags, assertions, profiler, and GPU debug annotations active, while `Engine/Editor/` is unlinked. Runs directly against loose project content **without binary packaging or CI workflows**.
- **`FRONTIER_PROFILE_SHIPPING`** (`-DFRONTIER_PROFILE=Shipping`): Production release binary (`Engine/Editor/` excluded at CMake target level, assertions/diagnostics/annotations stripped, full optimizations enabled). Produces packaged standalone binary archives and gates release GitHub Actions (which require explicit user approval before triggering).

---

## 🔴 6. MANDATORY `Exhibits/Images/` VISUAL PROOFS & HTML-ONLY `Experimental/` POLICY (2026-11-10)

- **Every `Exhibits/` Target Produces `.png` Visual Proofs**:
  - When an `Exhibits/*Validation` executable runs, it **MUST** write deterministic `.png` visual proof images into `Exhibits/Images/<Domain>/` — either a CPU software mirror of the UI/window/surface or a visual comparison/telemetry chart showing exactly what the user would see when running it.
  - **"It compiles" is never proof, and OS/GPU excuses are forbidden**: Never tell the user that a visual proof cannot be rendered because the environment is Linux rather than Windows or lacks a hardware GPU. Always render the visual proof on CPU / SwiftShader and present the resulting `.png` image(s).
  - Note the strict separation: **Engine runtime & Editor viewports** draw overlays 100% on GPU via `.slang` (§1), whereas **`Exhibits/` headless verification binaries** include a self-contained CPU rasterizer / image encoder solely to emit `.png` visual proofs into `Exhibits/Images/<Domain>/`.
- **`Experimental/` Holds HTML/JS Reference Prototypes Only (Zero C++)**:
  - All prototypes under `Experimental/` are browser HTML/JS/CSS specifications; native C++20 implementations belong exclusively in `Engine/` and `Exhibits/`.
  - **`Experimental/ProjectZeroEditor/`** is the starting visual & structural reference for shared UI components (`Engine/Components/`). Note DM Sans metrics when rasterizing in ImGui: CSS `font-size` scales the `1000 em` box while ImGui scales `ascent - descent`, requiring a `1.302` multiplier (`hhea` ascent `992`, descent `-310`) so ImGui text matches browser pixel sizing.
