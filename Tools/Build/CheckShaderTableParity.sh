# CMakeLists.txt and ToolchainSequence.ps1 must lower the SAME set of shaders.
#
#    This gate exists because they did not, and the divergence cost a whole feature. ShadowResolve.slang and the two
#    ShadowRaster stages were listed in CMakeLists.txt but missing from the PowerShell table. On Linux/CMake the
#    shadows worked; on Windows — which is what the project is actually built and run on — the three .spv files were
#    never produced, the shadow stage could not bring up its pipelines, and every frame fell through to the unshadowed
#    path. The renderer looked like it had a shadow bug. It had a build-script bug.
#
#    Neither list is the authority: the gate asserts they are EQUAL, in both directions, so adding a shader to one and
#    forgetting the other fails here rather than in a screenshot.
#
#    usage: bash Tools/Build/CheckShaderTableParity.sh
