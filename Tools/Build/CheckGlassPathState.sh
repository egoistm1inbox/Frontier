# Glass path-state regression gate.
#
# The BSDF/furnace gate proves the local reflection/refraction math. This small source gate
# protects the renderer-side medium state that the CPU furnace cannot exercise: a reflection
# from the front face of solid glass must not inherit the interior Beer/exit state, and the
# active medium must be keyed by the instance/material pair rather than the primary material
# alone.
