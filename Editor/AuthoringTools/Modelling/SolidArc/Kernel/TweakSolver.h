// 📦 Editor/EditorTools/ParametricSketcher/Kernel/TweakSolver.h — Translate one face, edge or vertex of a solid on fixed topology
//============================================================================================================================================
// A tweak moves a set of body vertices by one vector and re-fits only the geometry that touches them; no vertex, edge,
//    loop or face is created or destroyed, so closure and manifoldness are structural rather than something a Boolean
//    has to rediscover. The bounded domain is the polyhedral B-rep SolidArc already builds exactly:
//
//      • every edge touching a moved vertex is a straight line and is rebuilt between its (moved) vertices;
//      • a face whose vertices all move is translated rigidly (any surface type);
//      • a natural four-sided face (degree 1×1, four poles — box faces, extrusion sides, loft rectangles) has its poles
//        set to its corners: it stays a Plane when the corners remain coplanar, otherwise it becomes a bilinear patch,
//        which is exact but only accepted when the caller opts into warping;
//      • a trimmed planar face (extrusion and prism caps, n-gons) keeps its plane and its coedge traces are refitted,
//        provided every moved vertex stays in that plane — an n-gon cannot warp, so otherwise the tweak refuses.
//
// What that means for the questions a modeller asks: translating a box face by ANY vector keeps all six faces planar
//    (the neighbours become parallelograms); translating a box edge keeps the two faces along it planar and warps the
//    two end faces unless the vector has no component along the edge; translating a box vertex warps its three faces.
//    The tweak never detects a face passing through another; it refuses only an inverted or degenerate result. The one
//    curved exception is the exact native right-cylinder route: a complete circular cap/edge may move axially, while
//    arbitrary curved faces, arcs and non-native curved edges continue to refuse explicitly.
