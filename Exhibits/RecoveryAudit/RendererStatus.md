# Renderer and ReSTIR GI status — 2026-10-28

## Bottom line

**ReSTIR GI is not complete or connected to the editor.** The current repository has a bounded,
SwiftShader-executed software-traced research path with temporal/spatial replay, dynamic-light and blocker
fixtures and image readbacks. An [Engine command recorder](../LightCompute/PathReplayEngine.md) now schedules
normal replay and [bounded static colour reconstruction](../LightCompute/ReplayReconstruction.md) in that fixture;
Vulkan resource creation and submission remain caller-owned. It does not have an accepted production scene/render
loop, general dynamic and deforming-geometry reprojection, converged denoising
or a tested physical GPU path. There is no defensible single completion percentage without defining and testing a
full production acceptance checklist.

Both inspected editor routes explicitly display a scene-canvas placeholder:
`Frontier/Applications/Editor/FrontierMain.cpp` and `UI/Editor/EditorWorkspace.cpp`. An Engine source file,
or a Vulkan validation host in Exhibits, is not by itself evidence that the editor uses it.

## Ray tracing versus non-ray paths

- The tested GI and reflection research shaders trace triangles using software BVH traversal on Vulkan
  compute. The demo also calls its route “RTX”/TLAS/BLAS, but its pinned upstream
  [`RayTraversal.wgsl`](https://github.com/SultanAladin/Frontier/blob/6afb6f00b5f25c45f7cda92c7da65b64845768f3/Experimental/VehicleHmiPrototype/Shader/RayTraversal.wgsl)
  explicitly describes **hardware-agnostic** traversal and uses storage-buffer BVH nodes, a shader stack and
  triangle intersections. Such software ray tracing is not evidence of hardware ray-query/RT-core use.
- A search of the inspected Engine/editor source for `VK_KHR_ray_tracing`, `VK_KHR_ray_query`,
  `accelerationStructure`, `RayQuery` and `vkCmdTraceRays` found no hardware-RT implementation. This is a
  scoped source audit, not a guarantee about uninspected dependencies or external branches. Hardware RT device
  feature negotiation, acceleration structures, shader binding/invocation, dynamic updates and physical-GPU
  validation remain open.
- Screen-space reflection proposals and distance-field traversal exist in validation paths; a finished,
  editor-integrated **non-ray-traced ReSTIR GI** alternative is not established. Distance-field marching is
  still ray-based even when it does not use triangle BVHs or hardware RT. Raster/offscreen PBR exists but is
  not the completed alternative GI pipeline.

## Actual tested capabilities and gaps

| Area | Evidence | Still missing |
|---|---|---|
| Dynamic/multibounce GI | [Moving-light and blocker fixture](../LightCompute/ReplayFacetMixtureMotion.md), [14 captures](../LightCompute/ReplayFacetMixtureMotionCaptures.md), [2,048-seed follow-up](../LightCompute/ReplayRigidVarianceRepeat.md) and [bounded static colour history](../LightCompute/ReplayReconstruction.md) test limited scenes on CPU Vulkan | General unbiasedness/PRNG dependence, rare paths, arbitrary animated/deforming geometry, production integration, physical GPU and motion-safe denoising; current colour history resets globally on scene revisions |
| Reflections | [Rough sampled screen proposals with software-BVH fallback](../LightCompute/RoughReflections.md), limited specular history and [static rough-opaque replay colour accumulation](../LightCompute/ReplayReconstruction.md) | General motion/disocclusion, roughness-mip screen-colour history, full temporal specular reconstruction, general multi-bounce/noise acceptance, hardware RT and editor linkage |
| PBR | [Offscreen authored opaque/coating material pipelines](../Renderer/README.md), plus separate research glass/transport fixtures | Unified transmission/refraction, SSS, complex-IOR/multiple-scattering acceptance, converged GI, authoring/document material assignment, colour/presentation and native editor integration |
| Atmosphere, clouds, fog | CPU atmosphere and reference sky; cloud/fog GPU shader payloads and bounded validation | Full GPU atmosphere/volume production scheduling, scene linkage and measured sky/volume acceptance |
| Sun, Moon, stars, flares | CPU celestial model and actual demo Moon texture; isolated Vulkan Sun and simultaneous flare components | GPU/editor Moon, star and general celestial integration, Moon occlusion/indirect-light coverage, lens calibration and texture licence review |
| Analytic / emissive lights | Bounded clustered point/spot/IES checks; global area/luminance emissive distribution | **Clustered emissive triangles**, broad IES/scene coverage and production submission; global CDF is not a clustered light grid |
| Tyres | Standalone GPU [XPBD projection](../VehiclePhysics/TyreProjectionDevice.md), [Hex8 solid](../VehiclePhysics/TyreSolidDevice.md) and [curved-shell](../VehiclePhysics/TyreMembraneDevice.md), including resident surface probes on SwiftShader | Shell mechanics counterexamples, standalone spring-contact dynamics, measured tyre validation, stable hard-drop results, physical GPU, actual mesh rendering and editor integration |
| Gas / fluids | [Engine footprints and demo WGSL transport](../FluidReference/PlumeTransport.md); separate [matched face-flux pressure prototype](../FluidReference/GasProjection.md) passes bounded checks | Original plume pressure defect remains; prototype needs compatible advection, moving/open boundaries and production scheduling; scene/editor rendering, extended stability and physical validation; liquid solver not established |

The vehicle dynamics/Jolt port remains explicitly deferred. The new tyre work is standalone and does not
change it.

## What the GI chart actually means

In [the rigid-red chart](../LightCompute/ReplayRigidVarianceRepeat.md), the orange points are the **older
256-batch estimates**; green points are the newer 2,048-seed estimates, blue is the earlier CPU reference,
and the green vertical band is the new CPU mean ± two nominal standard errors. Horizontal bars are ± two
sample standard errors; the printed `±` numbers are ± one. These show uncertainty in this particular
fixture, not percentage completion or frame-rate improvement.

The newer mixture/spatial red standard deviation was `0.587×` uniform in that sample, but the earlier
estimate was `1.468×`, and the individual new groups ranged `0.306–1.203`. Rare bright paths dominate the
sample tails; the later [bounce audit](../LightCompute/ReplayRigidTailAudit.md) found the three largest
uniform paths hitting the same bright emissive triangle at zero-based bounce 2. Its mirrored breakdown
shares shader helpers and is not independent validation of path values, PDFs/MIS or random streams. The
old mean discrepancy remains unexplained. Spatial reuse costs additional work, so neither the lower SD nor
narrower bar is an equal-time speedup or proof of universally better images.
