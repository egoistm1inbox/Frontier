# CPU ReSTIR — the FIX-EVIDENCE sheet: what the two reuse paths were doing before, and what they do now.
#
#    The standard sheet (RunRestirViewport.sh) shows the product pipeline. This one shows the two convergence
#    paths the sheet cannot: every panel is the SAME renderer at the SAME budget, one switch apart, and each cell
#    carries its error against ①. Read it left to right, top to bottom:
#
#      ① the converged reference (brute force, 512 spp, one frame)
#      ② brute force at the same budget as the ReSTIR cells (4 spp × 128 frames)
#      ③ ReSTIR, 128 frames, 0 spatial taps   ⎫ the pre-fix signature was ③ improving with frames while ④ and ⑤
#      ④ ReSTIR, 128 frames, 2 spatial taps   ⎬ DEGRADED — spatial reuse fed its own output back into the
#      ⑤ ReSTIR, 128 frames, 4 spatial taps   ⎭ temporal history, so M compounded (mean 1 879, max 4 436 at
#                                                frame 16; 843 633 by frame 20). The fix: history takes the
#                                                TEMPORAL reservoir, and a tap's M cap reads the receiver's
#                                                PRE-merge count. Now more taps is strictly better.
#      ⑥ ④ with --restir-no-history-split (the fix's own A/B: history := post-spatial, the old loop)
#      ⑦ ④ with --restir-no-gi-reuse (the indirect half's single-sample arm)
#      ⑧ ④                                  (the indirect half's pool: ReSTIR GI-style reuse of the first-bounce
#                                            vertex's NEE stratum, temporally and over the same taps)
#
#    ⑨ THE FLOOR (roadmap #7). Every panel above is compared against ① on the SAME seed stream, which is deliberate —
#       4 spp × 128 frames IS the 512 seeds of the one-frame reference, so ② ≡ ① is bit-identical and doubles as this
#       script's sanity gate. But it also means each RMSE shares its noise with the arm being measured, and the
#       difference of two correlated estimators is smaller than the difference of two independent ones: those errors are
#       understated, by an amount nobody had measured. The last block therefore re-renders the plain arm and the
#       Standard arm on an INDEPENDENT stream (--seed-stream 1) and prints both numbers side by side, so the shared
#       figure can be read for what it is — a lower bound on the error — with the honest one on the record beside it.
#       ⚠️ --seed-stream 0 is the identity, so every panel above is unchanged by this existing.
#
#    Deterministic, like the standard sheet: every RNG is seeded from (pixel, sample index, frame).
